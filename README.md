# Medical_Appointment_No_Shows_data_analysis
This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row.

I deeply analyzed the data and tracked the main reason for not showing trying to know What factors are important for us to know; in order to predict if a patient will show up for their scheduled appointment or not?

The following questions were answered:
1-Is age besides gender or any other feature related to the no-show?
2-What is the effect of the neighborhood?
3-What is the effect of the appointment day?
4-What is the effect of the gap time?

To conclude the following outcomes:
1-There is no direct relation of absence between age and gender.
2-There is no great relation between hypertension and absence, fewer people with hypertension were absent but most of them were old.
3-Diabetes and Handicap have no relation to absence.
4-A lot of patients (old and young) who received SMS were absent!
5-Most absents have no scholarships and most of them were old.
6-There is a limit here which is we don't know the distance between the neighborhood and hospitals, however, the most two neighborhoods from which people were absent are JARDIM CAMBURI and MARIA ORTIX.
7-Most of the absence cases were on the working days of the week, people in Brazil work from Mondy to Friday.
8-The time gap between the appointment and scheduled dates may urge the patient to be absent!
